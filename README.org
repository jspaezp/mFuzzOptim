* MfuzzOpt (name under revision)

This is supposed to be a shiny gadget whose purpose is to make interactive the generation of plots based on the Mfuzz cMeans clustering package in R (currently located in Bioconductor)
** Usage Example
*** Using a gene expression dataset
#+BEGIN_SRC r
require(Mfuzz)

data("yeast")

# Data pre-processing
exprSet <- filter.NA(yeast, thres = 0.25)
exprSet <- fill.NA(exprSet, mode = "knn")
exprSet <- standardise(exprSet)

source("app.R/app.R")
mFuzzOpt(data = exprSet)

#+END_SRC
** Know Issues and todo
** TODO
- Return the code to obtain the graph when the app stops
- Organize as a package
